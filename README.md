# JavaBuzz
Challenge to test-drive FizzBuzz in JavaScript, using Jasmine.

## Rules
- Print numbers from 1 to 100
- Each number that is divisible by 3 must print "Java" instead.
- Each number that is divisible by 5 must print "Buzz" instead.
- Each number that is divisible by 3 && 5 must print "JavaBuzz" instead.

## How To Try
- git clone
- type open SpecRunner.html in the terminal
- press cmd+opt+j to open the console in Chrome
- type: var javabuzz = new Javabuzz();
        for (var i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
            console.log(javabuzz.says(i)); }
- voila
